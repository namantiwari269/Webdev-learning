  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am Naman Tiwari, a 3rd-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. With a strong academic foundation (CGPA 8.5), I am deeply passionate about core electronics, programming, and interdisciplinary applications like IoT, drones, and embedded systems.</p>
  <p>My technical toolkit spans Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, and SQL, along with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. I also have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, data structures, computer networks, operating systems, and DBMS.</p>
  <p>Beyond academics, I actively contribute as the Technical Lead of ECE Society, BIT Mesra, where I have organized workshops, technical quizzes, and seminars for 100+ students, fostering peer-to-peer learning and engagement.</p>
  <p>I am continuously learning and expanding my skill set, recently completing the NPTEL course on Education for Sustainable Development (100% score) and pursuing the Psychology of Learning. My curiosity drives me to bridge theory with real-world applications, whether in UAV design, IoT systems, or cutting-edge sustainable technologies.</p>
